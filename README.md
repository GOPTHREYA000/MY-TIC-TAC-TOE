Hello guys, This is a web application called "Tic-Tac-Toe" game it is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a responsive web interface with a two-player game logic, interactive grid, and dynamic message updates to display the winner or a draw, making it a user-friendly and engaging web-based gaming experience. and starting with a small general username and password form and then redirects to the game...
